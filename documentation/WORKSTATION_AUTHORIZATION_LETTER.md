MEMORANDUM & WORKSTATION AUTHORIZATION REQUEST

TO:      Chief Medical Information Officer (CMIO) / Director of Health Informatics / IT Infrastructure Committee
FROM:    [Your Name, MD / DO / NP / PA / RN / Clinical Lead]
DATE:    [Date]
SUBJECT: Request for Installation of PocketGull Clinical Font Superfamily on Clinical Workstations & COW Units

Dear [CMIO / IT Director / Clinical Systems Administrator],

I am writing to formally request the installation and whitelisting of the open-source PocketGull typeface superfamily on our clinic and hospital workstations, including ambulatory exam rooms, Citrix virtual desktop endpoints, and mobile Computer on Wheels (COW) carts.

1. THE CLINICAL RATIONALE & PATIENT SAFETY
Standard operating system fonts (such as Arial, Calibri, and Segoe UI) are designed for corporate office productivity rather than high-acuity medical care. During prolonged 12-hour shifts and under low-contrast or off-axis monitor viewing, standard fonts contribute significantly to cognitive visual fatigue and introduce life-critical medication transcription risks:
  • 10-Fold Dosing Errors: The Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP) explicitly prohibits trailing zeroes (e.g. writing "5.0 mg" instead of "5 mg") because a dirty screen or low-contrast display can transform "5.0" into "50 mg" (a fatal 10-fold overdose).
  • Alphanumeric Confusion: Standard fonts present identical vertical stems for numeral "1", lowercase "l", and uppercase "I", leading to medication and patient record errors.
  • Peripheral Crowding: Under Bouma’s Law of Lateral Crowding (r ≈ 0.5 × eccentricity), peripheral vitals numbers blend together during surgical or emergency room focus.

2. HOW POCKETGULL RESOLVES THESE HAZARDS
PocketGull is an open-source, mathematically standardized 1000 UPM clinical typeface superfamily engineered specifically for medical EHRs, bedside vitals monitors, and diagnostic HUDs:
  • ISMP & FDA Life-Critical Disambiguation: Natively enforces OpenType slashed zeroes (cv08), curved lowercase "l" (cv05), and serifed uppercase "I" (ss02), completely eliminating character collisions.
  • Louise Sloan 5:1 Optotypic Proportion: Engineered to the Johns Hopkins Wilmer Eye Institute standard (5 arcminutes total height, 1 arcminute stroke width and counter aperture at 55 cm reading distance), guaranteeing maximum optical legibility during fatigue.
  • Bedside 203 DPI Interoperability: Quantized to 8 dots/mm integer stems, rendering razor-sharp medication orders on direct-thermal Zebra wristband and IV bag printers with zero dithering.
  • 256 Unicode Braille (U+2800–U+28FF): Full tactile pharmaceutical labeling compliance.

3. CYBERSECURITY, COMPLIANCE & TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS
  • Zero Egress & Zero Tracking: PocketGull consists purely of local OpenType/TrueType (.ttf) and webfont (.woff2) vector font files. It contains ZERO tracking scripts, ZERO external API calls, and zero network dependencies.
  • 100% HIPAA Safe Harbor: Operates entirely client-side on the local machine with zero ePHI exposure.
  • Open-Source & Zero Licensing Cost: Released under the SIL Open Font License 1.1 (OFL-1.1), permitting unrestricted enterprise, hospital, and clinical use with zero software licensing fees.
  • Low-Impact Deployment: Files can be silently distributed via Microsoft Intune, SCCM, or Windows Group Policy (GPO) to %WINDIR%\Fonts, or applied via Citrix Workspace user profile layers without modifying system registry binaries.

4. REQUESTED ACTION
We request approval to install the three core TrueType font binaries:
  1. PocketGull-Bold.ttf (Display & Placards)
  2. PocketGull-Fineliner.ttf (EHR Body & Clinical Prescribing)
  3. PocketGullMono-Regular.ttf (Fixed-width Telemetry, Vitals & Terminal HUDs)

I would be happy to coordinate a brief 30-day pilot within our department or floor to demonstrate the reduction in visual strain and enhanced legibility across our clinical team.
