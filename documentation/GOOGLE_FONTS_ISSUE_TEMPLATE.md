### Description
PocketGull is an open-source clinical handwriting and display typeface superfamily designed by Phil Gear. Originating from spontaneous felt marker lettering created on physical cardstock for GearArts fine art and photographic editions, PocketGull bridges tactile humanist warmth with Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP) glyph disambiguation and Louise Sloan 5:1 optotypic legibility standards.

The family contains 4 coordinated static styles:
1. **PocketGull-Bold.ttf** (Weight: 700) — Confident headline & prescription marker
2. **PocketGull-Fineliner.ttf** (Weight: 400) — Delicate text & dosage pen lettering
3. **PocketGull-Chiseltip.ttf** (Weight: 900) — Expressive calligraphic display & trauma headers
4. **PocketGullMono-Regular.ttf** (Weight: 400, Monospace 600 UPM pitch) — ICU telemetry, tabular figures, & clinical terminal output
