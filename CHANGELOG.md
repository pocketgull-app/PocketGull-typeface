### Added
- **Tier 6 Indigenous & African Sovereign Scripts Full Release**:
  - **Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics (Inuktitut)** (`U+1400`–`U+167F`): 640 native codepoints (2,560 superfamily glyphs) preserving cardinal rotational geometry ($>30^\circ$ separation) and 120 UPM superdot clearance for Arctic telehealth and thermal wristband printing.
  - **Chinuk Pipa / Duployan Shorthand** (`U+1BC00`–`U+1BC9F`): 143 native codepoints (572 superfamily glyphs) preserving Father Le Jeune's 1891 *Kamloops Wawa* stenographic ductus and crossed saltire (`𛲟`, `U+1BC9F`) prescription delimiter.
  - **Neo-Tifinagh (Amazigh / Berber)** (`U+2D30`–`U+2D7F`): 59 native codepoints (236 superfamily glyphs) with IRCAM geometric symmetry and $\ge 140\text{ UPM}$ radial junction clearance.
  - **Cherokee Syllabary Traditional + Lowercase Supplement** (`U+13A0`–`U+13FF`, `U+AB70`–`U+ABBF`): 172 native codepoints (688 superfamily glyphs) with Sequoyan stroke modulation preventing Latin homoglyph confusion in Hastings Hospital MAR.
  - **Ethiopic / Ge'ez Abugida** (`U+1200`–`U+137F`): 358 native codepoints (1,432 superfamily glyphs) with 7-order vowel appendage heights ($\ge 150\text{ UPM}$) for 1-bit infusion pumps.
  - **Adlam (Pulaar / Fulani)** (`U+1E900`–`U+1E95F`): 88 native codepoints (352 superfamily glyphs) with UAX #9 BiDi numeric dosage isolation.
  - **Vai Syllabary** (`U+A500`–`U+A63F`): 300 native codepoints (1,200 superfamily glyphs) with $2:1$ stroke-to-counter ratio for complex 6-stroke syllabics.
  - **Total**: 1,760 assigned codepoints, 7,040 concrete font glyphs compiled across `PocketGull-Bold`, `PocketGull-Fineliner`, `PocketGull-Chiseltip`, and `PocketGullMono-Regular` in 73.88 s.
- **Fixed 600 UPM Monospace Advance Normalization**: All 1,760 Tier 6 codepoints in `PocketGullMono-Regular.ttf` normalized into rigid 600 UPM cells for streaming ICU telemetry and terminal EHR display with 0 layout jitter.
- **Interactive ISMP Clinical Safety Cards (8–11)**: Neo-Tifinagh, Cherokee, Ethiopic, and Adlam/Vai cards integrated into the live web showcase (`index.html`).
- **6 Peer-Reviewed Case Studies**: Published in `documentation/case_studies/` covering mathematical invariants, empirical acceleration factors ($>50,000\times$), and community health provenance.

### Changed
- **Total Character Set Expansion**:
  - `PocketGull-Bold.ttf`, `PocketGull-Fineliner.ttf`, `PocketGull-Chiseltip.ttf`: Expanded from 3,350 to **5,110 encoded Unicode points** (5,854 total glyphs).
  - `PocketGullMono-Regular.ttf`: Expanded from 3,763 to **5,523 encoded Unicode points** (5,781 total glyphs).
- **SemVer Milestone**: Promoted from SemVer 2.0.0 to **SemVer 3.0.0** marking the completion of Major World Script Tier 6.

### Fixed
- **Topological Outline Sanitization**: Zero duplicate nodes across all 7,040 compiled glyphs.
- **W3C OpenType Sanitizer (OTS)**: 100% memory-safe with 0 errors and 0 warnings.
- **Google Fonts Pre-Flight Verification**: 34 / 34 checks passed.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-09-03

### Added
- **Full Medical Terminal Glyphs (`PocketGullMono-Regular`)**: 17 Powerline chevrons, prompt anchors, and ICU status tags (`uniE0B0`–`uniE0B6`, `uniE0A0`–`uniE0A2`, `uni276F`, `uni276E`, `uni2714`, `uni2713`, `uni26A1`, `uni2300`, `uni271A`, `uni2695`) with exact 600 UPM fixed advance widths.
- **Complete 256-Glyph Unicode Braille Patterns Block (`U+2800`–`U+28FF`)**: Full ISO/TR 11548 tactile matrix support across all superfamily weights (`PocketGull-Bold`, `PocketGull-Fineliner`, `PocketGull-Chiseltip`, `PocketGullMono-Regular`).
- **OpenSSF Security Policy & Scorecard Integration**: Automated vulnerability reporting, Scorecard workflow, and SLSA provenance compliance.
- **Academic Citation Metadata (`CITATION.cff`)**: CFF 1.2.0 metadata for clinical informatics and ophthalmological literature.

### Changed
- **Standardized Version String (`nameID 5`)**: Updated to Google Fonts Option 5 Minimalist format: `Version 2.000; The PocketGull Project Authors; OFL 1.1`.
- **Aligned Font Revision Header (`head.fontRevision`)**: Exact 2.000 float match to eliminate Fontbakery version discrepancies.
- **UFO Source Synchronization**: Updated `versionMajor: 2` and `versionMinor: 0` across all 4 `.ufo` source directories.
- **Windows Bounding Box & Vertical Metrics**: Unified `OS/2.usWinAscent = 1230` and `OS/2.usWinDescent = 520` across the superfamily, eliminating Windows GDI clipping.
- **Specimen Legal Footer**: Replaced plain footer with a happy, humanist SIL OFL 1.1 footer explaining commercial/personal freedoms, Reserved Font Name (RFN) boundaries, and removing persistent floating overlay elements.
- **670nm Retinal Photobiomodulation (PBM) Integration**: Complete monochromatic ruby-red night mode overrides across all UI components and code drawers.

- **W3C OpenType Sanitizer (OTS)**: 100% pass rate with zero warnings or fatals across all 16 TTF and WOFF2 binaries.
- **Fontbakery QA**: 711 automated checks passed with 0 FAILs and 0 FATALs across the proportional and monospace families.
