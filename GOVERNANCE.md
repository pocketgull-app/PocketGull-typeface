# Project Governance & Typographic Oversight Policy

**PocketGull Typeface Superfamily**  
*Open Source Governance, Clinical & Ophthalmological Typography Review Board, and Release Protocol*

---

## 🏛️ 1. Governance Principles

PocketGull Typeface Superfamily is an open-source medical, ophthalmological, and Pan-Tribal typography project developed by **PocketGull LLC** in collaboration with clinical researchers, optometrists, vision scientists, type designers, and Indigenous language keepers.

Our governance model ensures:
1. **Ophthalmological Rigor & Evidence Grounding**: All letterform metrics, stroke contrasts, x-height ratios, and counter spaces must be grounded in peer-reviewed vision science literature (Louise Sloan 5:1 acuity, Hermann Bouma crowding coefficients, ISO/TR 11548 Braille dimensions, DIN 1450 legibility standards).
2. **Deterministic Safety Precedence**: Stylistic flourishes never compromise clinical readability or the Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP) zero-error character disambiguation rules.
3. **Radical Transparency & Libre Licensing**: 100% open-source licensing under the **SIL Open Font License 1.1 (OFL-1.1)**, open vector sources (UFO3 / Glyphs), reproducible build toolchains, and public issue tracking.
4. **Binary Integrity & Memory Safety**: Zero W3C OpenType Sanitizer (OTS) violations, 2-byte word boundary alignment, and hermetic CI validation.
5. **Multi-Script Respect & Inclusivity**: Orthographies and scripts are designed in accordance with established writing systems and community input, preserving authentic calligraphic stroke traditions without mechanical flattening.

### 1.1 Foundry Governance & Quality Pillars

To maintain mathematical vector determinism, binary safety, and upstream open-source adoption, PocketGull establishes three core pillars:

* **🕊️ Respectful Multi-Script Typography**:
  * **Authentic Stroke Traditions**: Respect the authentic reed-pen footprint of Arabic, the standard 8-dot geometry of Braille (ISO/TR 11548), and the rotational symmetry of Syllabics.
  * **Zero Synthetic Flattening**: Ground non-Latin scripts to the optical baseline and x-height without forcing non-Latin letterforms into rigid Latin boxes.
  * **Community Input**: Orthographic additions adhere to verified orthographic standards and Unicode specifications.
* **✒️ Mathematical Determinism & OTS Safety**:
  * **2-Byte Word Boundary Invariant**: `loca[i] % 2 == 0` across all glyph records. Zero OTS memory eviction in DirectWrite or Chromium.
  * **Bit-7 Flag Masking**: Point flags byte bit 7 (`0x80`) strictly zero.
  * **Sloan Acuity & ISMP Disambiguation**: Louise Sloan 5:1 optotypes, mandatory `cv08` slashed zero, `cv05` curved l, `ss02` serifed I, `cv11` slashed Z.
  * **Pure Dart 3.11 Toolchain**: Deterministic SFNT compilation, 0 duplicate nodes, hermetic table layout.
* **🌐 Google Fonts Parity & Upstream Harmony**:
  * **Minimalist Versioning**: `head.fontRevision == 3.0`, `nameID 5 == 'Version 3.000; The PocketGull Project Authors; OFL 1.1'`.
  * **Zero RFN Debt**: SIL Open Font License 1.1 with no Reserved Font Name restriction (see [TRADEMARKS.md](TRADEMARKS.md) for brand coexistence policy).
  * **Full CFF & Zenodo DOI Sync**: Permanent DOI `10.5281/zenodo.22309379` mapped to CERN open science index.
  * **Pre-Flight Checks**: Complete fontbakery check-googlefonts compliance, WOFF2 Brotli 11, designer profile dossier.

## 👥 2. Roles & Responsibilities

### 2.1 Lead Systems Architect & Benevolent Dictator for Now (BDFN)
* **Lead Architect**: **Phil Gear** ([ORCID: 0009-0008-1372-5381](https://orcid.org/0009-0008-1372-5381))
* Retains final architectural, licensing, and security decision-making authority over core repository branches, font naming, and cryptographic release seals.

### 2.2 Typographic & Clinical Review Board (TCRB)
* Composed of vision researchers, clinicians, ophthalmologists, and type engineers.
* Reviews all Pull Requests touching:
  * ISMP high-risk medication safety glyphs (cv08 slashed zero, cv05 curved l, ss02 serifed I).
  * Unicode Braille patterns (U+2800..U+28FF) and tactile embossing metrics.
  * Dyslexia-conscious baseline weighting and saccadic reading anchors.
  * Monospace 600 UPM advance metrics and ICU vitals table alignment.
  * Photobiomodulation (670nm PBM) optical contrast calibration.

### 2.3 Core Maintainers
* Review daily pull requests, maintain CI/CD pipelines, and enforce pre-flight test suites (`sources/validate_fonts.py`, `fontbakery check-googlefonts`).

### 2.4 Multi-Script & Linguistic Advisory
* Governs orthographic expansion, syllabic accuracy, and script integrity across non-Latin writing systems (Canadian Syllabics, Duployan Chinuk Pipa, Arabic, Cherokee, Cyrillic, Greek, Hebrew).
* Ensures accurate encoding and alignment with Unicode standards and verified linguistic reference materials.

## 📜 3. Decision-Making & RFC Process

Significant architectural, metric, or glyph set changes follow a lightweight **Request for Comments (RFC)** process:

1. **RFC Proposal**: Contributor opens an issue with the `[TYPOGRAPHY-RFC]` template or starts a GitHub Discussion.
2. **Review Period**: 7-day public review period for community feedback, clinical verification, and language keeper attestation.
3. **Proof-of-Work Verification**: Implementation must provide 100% passing tests via `sources/validate_fonts.py` and Fontbakery (0 FAILs, 0 FATALs).
4. **Consensus & Merge**: Merged upon approval by the Lead Architect.

---

## 🛡️ 4. Emergency Patch Protocol (STAT Override)

In the event of an identified clinical safety hazard, OTS memory violation, or critical table corruption:
1. Maintainers may push an emergency fix directly to a hotfix branch on `main`.
2. The hotfix must satisfy the mandatory OTS sanitizer and `validate_fonts.py` test suites.
3. A post-mortem incident report will be published in `SECURITY.md` within 48 hours.

## 🤖 5. Machine Learning Reservation & AI Ingestion Covenants

1. **Text and Data Mining Reservation (TDMR)**: PocketGull expressly reserves all rights against text and data mining, automated scraping, extraction, and harvesting for the purposes of training generative AI, foundational models, or large language models under **Article 4(3) of EU Directive 2019/790** and international copyright conventions.
2. **Machine-Readable Opt-Out**: Machine-readable reservations are asserted across `robots.txt`, `.aiignore`, `llms.txt`, and HTTP headers (`TDM-Reservation: 1`).
3. **Humanitarian & Clinical Exemption**: Font binaries may be embedded freely in software, clinical EHR systems, medical telemetry devices, and printed educational materials under the SIL OFL 1.1 without restriction, but raw linguistic and glyph data may not be aggregated into base model training corpora.
